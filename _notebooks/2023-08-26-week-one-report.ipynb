    "During **monday**: we were able to have more time to work on our blog for the up and coming tools check. We were anticipating and were very nervous about what grade we would get. We learned that if we did everything we were supposed to we'd only get a 90% but only and only if we go above and beyong we would receive higher than a 90%. I was researching the web on how to make a blog homepage better to impress our teacher and took some basic markdown cheat sheets to make my page look more appealing. We learned that markdown is one of the simplest languages to learn to convey basic information like we did on blogs. Some markdown commands I learned during this process are:\n",

    "During the day on **Tuesday** me and my partner, sri, were finalizing our blog as we were going to present tomorrow on wednesday. As soon as I opened my macbook my make command stopped working and I could not create the local serve to show my blog site. We were stressed and were freaking out because we did not know what the problem with this was. After an hour of not being able to fix it we proceeded to go to the teacher to ask him for help. We discussed that it was best for me to leave the machine with him to help him figure out the issue that I was facing, but during my 4th period class I was exploring the issue on my own when it was working again. During the troubleshoting of that command I was not able to make any process on that day so me and my partner proceeded to call to work on it more and prepare our \"speech\". \n",

After doing the live review I realized that what we did was not enough for 2 points but we got a 1.85 for changing the theme. We changed our theme to the theme \"modernist\" and we realized that it looked the best after trying ot multiple themes that were available on jekyll. We changed the theme by removing the commenting hashtag in the _config.yml file. "
