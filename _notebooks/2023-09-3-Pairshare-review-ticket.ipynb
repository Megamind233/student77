    "2. calculator(event): This function calculates the total, count, and average of entered scores when the \"Tab\" or \"Enter\" key is pressed. It updates the webpage with these values and adds a new input box if all previous scores are valid numeric values.\n",
    "3. window.onload: This event ensures the first input box is created when the webpage loads, allowing users to start entering scores.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `<table>` tag starts the table.\n",
    "- Inside, there's a `<thead>` section for column headers defined using `<th>` tags.\n",
    "- The `</thead>` tag closes the header section.\n",
    "- The `<tbody>` section contains data rows with each row enclosed in `<tr>` tags.\n",
    "- In each data row, you use `<td>` tags for actual data cells.\n",
    "- Finally, the `</tbody>` and `</table>` tags close the table.\n",
