    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Wikipedia**\n",
    "    - Imports the `wikipedia` library to use Wikipedia's features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function `multiple_choice()`**\n",
    "    - Main function of the program.\n",
    "    - **User Choice**: Asks you to choose between getting a summary (\"A\") or doing a search (\"B\").\n",
    "    - **If 'A'**: If you choose \"A\", it asks you what topic you want a summary of, then prints the Wikipedia summary.\n",
    "    - **Else**: If you choose anything other than \"A\", it assumes you want to search. It asks what you want to search for, then prints a list of matching Wikipedia articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run Function**\n",
    "    - Runs the `multiple_choice()` function to start the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it will ask you to choose between getting a summary or searching for a topic on Wikipedia, and then show you the results.\n",
