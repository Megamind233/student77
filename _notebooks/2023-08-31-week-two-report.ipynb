    "#### Monday\n",
    "We started off Monday with a small little tech talk about the new blog interface and how the changes are to made, either surgically or by copying and making a new repository of the new template. WE then create two new post on for a week 1 summary ie, a summary of all the things that we did in week 1 and another for week 2 plans ie all the stuff that we are going to be doing for week 2 planned out all in advace. I then commited my post and changes from VSCode into github, and also got the [github.io](github.io) pages working\n",

    "We began Tuesday by completing the week 2 plans that we started of eairler and also began changing the meta data on top of each of the new post so as to include thier links in the the ongoing notebook calender of the new interphase. Here I faced a few little problems regarding the github pages, this was mostly because of there being two repositories with very similar name and what I feel is that git got confused between the two and kept going back to the old one when I changed links on the new one.\n",
    "Simple fix for that: Change the name of the github repository, like for student to studentold etc.\n",

    "#### Wednesday\n",
    "We started off just where we left off on Tuesday, gith pages. We managed to fix them and get them to work and then sat in to listen to a new tech talk about the snake game and the JS calculator type 2 version. After that I managed to get the snake game to work into my local host and also added in the calculator's code. Main error for the calucaltor was the asset files that inlcuded the JSS and CSS commands for the calc - basically made it look more good. SImple fix for that was to drag the asset file form the _site on VSC and drop it outside of it as changes made in the site directory last there for like 2 sec max. After that drag and drop the JS and CSS files into the new asset directory and your done! I then also manage to copy paste the life game code into the my local host and commit it into git. We also faced a make issue that we fixed with this command\n",
