    "In python there are a variety of ways to code a quiz. You can use basic print statements and input functions **or** you can use for loops to make the same quiz more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code is a basic quiz program that interacts with users. Here are the elements that make up most of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import getpass, sys`: This imports the  modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def question_with_answers(prompt)`: This defines a function that prints a question, collects user input as an answer, and stores the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "- `questions = 3`: This is the total number of questions in the quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `correct_answers = 0`: This variable keeps track of the amout of correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `question_list`: This list contains the questions for the quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ans_list`: This list holds the correct answers corresponding to the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `for` loop iterates over each question:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `rsp = question_with_answers(question_list[i])`: This line asks the user a question and stores their response into a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `if ans_list[i] == rsp:`: This checks if the user's response matches the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the answer is correct, `correct_answers` added by one, and a success message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the answer is incorrect, an print message is shown to help them know they got the question wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the end code displays a completion message for the quiz and calculates the user's percentage score.\n",
